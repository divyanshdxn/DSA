<h1 align="center">STACK QUESTIONS</h1>

- [x] **Duplicate Brackets:** You are given a string exp representing an expression.
  Assume that the expression is balanced i.e. the opening and closing brackets match with each other. There is always a
  closing bracket for each opening bracket.
  But, some pairs of brackets may be extra/needless. You are required to print true if you detect extra brackets
  and false
  otherwise. [Code](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/online-java-foundation/stacks-and-queues/duplicate-brackets-official/ojquestion)
- [x] **Balanced Brackets:** You are given a string exp representing an expression. You are required to check if the
